    <h1>BRIAN JING: Personal Site and Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Brian Jing, an incoming sophomore at UC San Diego studying data science! I'm passionate about developing AI products that solve real-world problems and improve business operations. In high school, most of my impact was in healthcare — from a convolutional neural network detecting tuberculosis to a random forest Alzheimer’s diagnosis model. But now, I'm expanding my impact beyond healthcare, looking to use those same AI tools to improve how businesses operate across many different industries.</p>
    <p>Currently, I’m taking inspiration from my interest in fitness to build POWERCOACH, an app that gives real-time feedback on weightlifting form to help gym-goers avoid injury and lift smarter.</p>
